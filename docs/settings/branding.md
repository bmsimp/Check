# Branding

The Branding section lets you customize how Check looks, especially useful for organizations that want consistent branding.

**For individual users**

Most individual users can skip this section unless they want to personalize the extension.

### What if Settings Are Not Visible?

If some settings do not appear on your version, it means your organization's IT department has set these for you. This is normal in business environments - your IT team wants to make sure everyone has the same security settings. You will also see text indicating that the extension is being managed by policy.

1. **Company Name** - Enter your organization's name. This appears in the extension interface and blocked page messages.
2. **Company URL** - Your company website URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.com`). Used in extension branding and contact information.
3. **Product Name** - What you want to call the extension (like "Contoso Security" instead of "Check"). This replaces the default "Check" branding throughout the interface.
4. **Support Email** - Where users should go for help. This email address is used in the "Contact Admin" button when phishing sites are blocked.

## Visual Customization

1. **Primary Color** - Choose a color that matches your brand. This color is applied to buttons, headers, and other interface elements throughout the extension.
2. **Logo URL** - Link to your company logo. This replaces the default Check logo in the extension popup, options page, and blocked page warnings.

## Live Preview

The branding preview shows you exactly how your customizations will appear to users. Changes are reflected immediately as you modify the settings, showing:

* Your custom logo and company name in the header
* How the primary color affects buttons and interface elements
* The overall visual appearance users will see

## Logo Requirements and Tips

### **Technical requirements:**

* Format: PNG, JPG, or SVG
